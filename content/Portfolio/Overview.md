**Problem**: 
- Quickly respond to dissatisfied user reviews, potentially extract application problems to improve user experience.

**Solution steps:**
1. We begin with the data, and find relevant review datasets for our use case.
	- Luckily we have Google Play Store reviews on theÂ [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/google-play-store-reviews/data)
1. Train (or fine-tune) a machine learning model on the data to analyze reviews for us.
2. Use the model to filter reviews quickly and help us respond quickly to dissatisfied reviews.
3. Potentially extract user feedback insights to help us improve our app. (that's out of the scope of this notebook, to be implemented later)
