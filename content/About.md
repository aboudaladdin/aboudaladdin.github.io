Hi! I am Abdelrahman, or Aboud for short.

I am interested in using AI to solve challenging problems and create value.

Focusing on natural language processing because modeling sequence data fascinates me.

My formal education as a nuclear and radiation engineer didnâ€™t include AI or machine learning, so as a result, I was more focused on learning new things.

I enjoy playing chess, build small electronic projects and drawing in my free time.
### Random Facts
- I have a BSc in nuclear and radiation engineering.
- I have spent a lot of time playing chess.
- I built my transistor radio as a kid.
- I enjoy working with electronics and building small systems.
